This project which is my first entry to apply to the Hackclub 400$ grant is a MIDI keyboard based on the korg nanokey fold which I deem cool but overpriced or at least not worth it to just outright buy it, because of this I am making 
NanoMidi a custom foldable MIDI keyboard that uses standard low profile keyboard switches and an ESP32 or similar board in order to be compact, useful and affordable.
The objective for this project is to make it foldable just like the original was or at least separate into two different parts which can be joined at the moment of use to make it as compact as possible.
