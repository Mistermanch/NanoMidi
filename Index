This project is a twist on the hackpad project by hackclub, the original objective is to design a macropad using the given tutorials and with this design a macropad and get the pieces shiped to you. 
The crucial change I´m doing is that insted of making a macropad I´m going to be making a MIDI keyboard similar for example to the korg nanokey fold which O see too expensive to justify outright buying.
The objectives I will try to match is for my project to be foldable, use low profile keyboard switches and be compatible with any standar computer.
